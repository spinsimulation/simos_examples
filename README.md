# Examples for SimOS

This repository contains IPython notebooks that demonstrate how to use the spin dynamics simulation software [SimOS](https://simos.kherb.io). The notebooks are organized by topic and are intended to be run with a Python installation that has the [simos](https://pypi.org/project/simos/) package installed. This can be done by running `pip install simos[recommended]` in your terminal.

 The notebooks can be viewed directly on GitHub, but to run them interactively, you will need to download them and run them on your local machine. Alternatively, you can run them in your browser using our [Virtual Lab](https://simos.kherb.io/virtual/lab/index.html?path=Welcome.ipynb). The Virtual Lab is a free service that allows you to run the notebooks without installing anything on your local machine.
